Thanks for visiting my profile page! Please see [my portfolio](https://me.ryey.icu) for more information about **me**.  
This file mainly states about my github repos, both as a useful guide in case you are interested, and as a reminder for myself about what I have done (ðŸ¤”not yet, but just in case unfortunately I forgot that I have done something previously).

### Highlights

- Some of my research outputs are open-source under [my account](https://github.com/renyuneyun/), or [OxfordHCC](https://github.com/OxfordHCC/).
- I'm releasing some libraries or utilities for [SoLiD (Social Linked Data)](https://solidproject.org/), as needed by myself.
  - SoLid is [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)'s fix for the WWW; Web 3.0 for W3C (no, it's NOT Web3; also see [my blog post (in Chinese)](https://blog.ryey.icu/on-web-3-0-and-web-3.html)).
- I'm the author of [Easer](https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer), a user-defined explicit automation app for Android, similar to Tasker. It was a leasure development since my Masters.
  - I believe the next step is (corss-platform) inter-device federation for it (contrary to centralized smart-home). Unfortunately I do not have enough time to maintain it now; Android is also making it hard to function correctly nowadays.
